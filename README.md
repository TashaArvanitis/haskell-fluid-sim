Fluid Simulations
=========

This is a [Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothed_particle_hydrodynamics) fluid simulation currently implemented in [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org).

Parts of the simulation:
  * OpenGL code for the simulator environment is in 'Simulator.hs'
  * Main simulation is 'Main.hs', with supporting files
  * Parsec parser for object mesh files is in 'ObjectParser.hs'
